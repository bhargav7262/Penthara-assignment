## ✨ What Can It Do?

I've packed this detailed dashboard with features to make expense management smooth:

-   **Secure Accounts:** Sign up and log in securely to keep your data private (powered by **Firebase Authentication**).
-   **Visual Insights:** See where your money is going at a glance with interactive charts (using **Recharts**).
-   **Easy Management:** Add new expenses quickly and delete the ones you no longer need.
-   **Cloud Storage:** Your data is saved safely in the cloud (**Firestore**), so you can access it from anywhere.
-   **Responsive Design:** It looks great and works perfectly on both your computer and mobile phone.
